        "Word Embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation. They are a distributed representation for text that is perhaps one of the key breakthroughs for the impressive performance of deep learning methods on challenging natural language processing problems.\n",

This is done since you are passing the windows as they are into the function.</li>\n",

When you create the gradient vector(s) for the target/context/negative samples, you can simply replace the corresponding row in that zeros matrix with that vector. The update equation will be very easy to implement.</li>\n",

If you're sure everything is correct, double-check your equations with the lecture slides - one wrong sign for a gradient cost me an hour of debugging ;-;</li>\n",
